# Android Fixes for Fitness App

## UI Improvements

1. **Fixed Bottom Navigation Bar**
   - Made the footer permanent rather than overlapping with the main content
   - Fixed by setting `extendBody: false` and adding `SafeArea` to the main scaffold

2. **Removed Duplicate Profile Title**
   - Removed the second AppBar in the UserProfileScreen
   - Now only one "Profile" title is shown from the parent screen

3. **Fixed Overflow Issues in Cardio Workouts**
   - Added horizontal scrolling for workout details that might overflow
   - Limited text to single lines with ellipsis where needed
   - Wrapped workout detail chips in a `SingleChildScrollView`

4. **Fixed Timer Issues in Workout Details**
   - Replaced blurry `GlassCard` with solid `Container` components
   - Added proper borders and background colors for better visibility
   - Improved contrast for better readability

5. **Renamed "Notifications" to "Alerts"**
   - Updated the title in the main bottom navigation bar
   - Class names are still NotificationScreen for compatibility

6. **Added Workout Reminder Customization**
   - Added ability to change time with time picker
   - Added ability to change days of the week with day picker
   - Improved UI for reminder settings

7. **Fixed Profile Photo Upload**
   - Now using the actual selected photo instead of hardcoded URL
   - Uses the file path of the selected image

## Android Compatibility

1. **Added Core Library Desugaring**
   - Fixed Java 8 features compatibility for Android
   - Added in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

2. **Created Android Flavor for Android 15**
   - Added fitness_app1 flavor for Android 15 compatibility
   - Updated gradle configuration

3. **Improved Run Scripts**
   - Created dedicated scripts for running on Android devices
   - Added device detection for Samsung device

## How to Run

Use one of the following scripts to run the app:

1. `run_android_fixed.bat` - Automatically detects Samsung device or falls back to any Android device
2. `run_android_samsung.bat` - Specifically targets the Samsung device with ID RZCX30EN3KE
3. `run_android.bat` - Simple script that runs on any connected Android device

All scripts use the `fitness_app1` flavor for Android 15 compatibility.
